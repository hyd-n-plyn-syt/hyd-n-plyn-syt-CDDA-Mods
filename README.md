## hyd-n-plyn-syt's C:DDA Mods

A collection of mods that I have, and shall create for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. After a while I will probably port them over to Bright Nights as well, but I'm having too much fun learning the container system's in's and outs right now. What I am not learning from simply sifting through other mods files, I'm learning from looking at the base game files, and limited sources that I can find on discourse, etc.

>##### Gunslinger Professions Mod
>Adds a handful of professions revolving around the classic western gunslinger trope, to the C:DDA fullest!

>##### Smart Cases Mod
>Adding waterproof cases to devices that don't have them in the base game.
