# hyd-n-plyn-syt C:DDA Mods

A collection of mods that I have, and shall create for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. After a while I will probably port them over to Bright Nights as well, but I'm having too much fun learning the container system's in's and outs right now.


>## Gunslinger Professions Mod

>- Currently adds 3 Gunslinger Professions. Plans to add more skill levels and other extras.
>>*Amateur Western Gunslinger - Amateur Bionic Gunslinger - Amateur Western 'Cow-Boy' Gunslinger*

>- Created mostly so that I can test out how mods work for CDDA. First attempt! Yeah, I'm not impressed either.

>- Will be kept as up to date with current experimentals as possible, in case of item name changes, etc.

>## Smart Cases Mod

>* An attempt to add more than standard waterproof cases for just smart phones and cameras, starting with the eInk Tablet, then AR Glasses, etcettera until we've run out of electronics that should have cases!

>* I would really like to look into creating cases that strap onto the body, goPro style. I know you can already activate it from anywhere, but maybe something that seriously reduces the movecost of snapping a photo of a zombie mid combat.
