## Gunslinger Professions Mod

##### Revamps the Wild West Gunslinger profession, and adds five more of similar style.

* **Amateur Wild West Gunslinger**
*Lower skill, and lower point cost. Slightly different starting gear, namely a revolver of lower caliber.*
* **Amateur Bionic Gunslinger**
*Same as his western counterpart, plus a basic shooter bionic package and some more star spangled gear. Same revolver as all other amateur gunslinger builds.*
* **Amateur Western Cow-Folk Gunslinger**
*Same as the other amateur level, with the addition of low tier cattle mutations and a couple extra vials of mutagen so you can get that extra fix, you freak.*
* **Wild West Gunslinger**
*Slightly revamped version of the Wild West Gunslinger from vanilla, replacing it when this mod is active. It adds in a few extras, and bumps up that social skill a notch. You are a showman after all.*
* **Bionic Gunslinger**
*Same skill level as his Western counterpart, but with some additional bionics and slightly different gearstyle.*
* **Western Cow-Folk Gunslinger**
*The same as the other two of this skill level, with the addition of being right at the cattle threshold, achieving a true level of cow-boy/girlness.*

**All of the professions have gendered undergarments, and I'd bother to gender their clothing entirely... except that I've lived in the middle of the middle of nowhere near ranchers, farmers, etc., and the women wear the same thing when they do the job. So. Yeah.**

**I've adjusted the proficiencies of the standard Gunslinger, and set all of the new ones accordingly. I'm pretty sure most gunslingers know how to pistol whip, so now they can do CQC with pistols by default, at varying degrees of ability, and some even the ability to craft some revolvers. You're welcome.**

**I am currently trying to figure out how to lock starting professions behind achievements, and the possibility of creating entirely custom ones for this, and future profession mods.** *We shall see*.
