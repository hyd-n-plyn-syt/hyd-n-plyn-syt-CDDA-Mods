## Smart Cases Mod

An attempt to add more than standard waterproof cases for just smart phones and cameras, starting with the eInk Tablet, then AR Glasses, etcettera until we've run out of electronics that should have cases! 

Now that I see there are a literal f*ckton of variants for smartphones after digging through files... I guess that will have to be a thing I add too. After I figure out the ascii art thing. For right now the cases borrow the ascii art of their chosen device if there is any in game already.

I would really like to look into creating cases that strap onto the body, goPro style. I know you can already activate it from anywhere, but maybe something that seriously reduces the movecost of snapping a photo of a zombie mid combat.

-------------------------------
So far, we have:
* e-Ink tablet PC cases
* basic and advanced AR glasses cases
* mp3 player cases

And we've slightly modified all smartphone cases to take up barely more space than the device they contain, freeing up about 45ml of space. I've also included ascii art for the e-Ink tablet, and the waterproof case for the e-Ink. More coming, eventually.
