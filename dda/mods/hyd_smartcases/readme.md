># - Smart Cases Mod

>* An attempt to add more than standard waterproof cases for just smart phones and cameras, starting with the eInk Tablet, then AR Glasses, etcettera until we've run out of electronics that should have cases!

>* I would really like to look into creating cases that strap onto the body, goPro style. I know you can already activate it from anywhere, but maybe something that seriously reduces the movecost of snapping a photo of a zombie mid combat.
