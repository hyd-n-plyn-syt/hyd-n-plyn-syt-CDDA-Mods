- Added waterproof e-ink tablet PC case. Compared it to camera and phone case weights versus device weights and made some judgements. Despite the container being of correct proportions, kept throwing an error saying the inside was larger than the outside. Marked it as TARDIS as suggested until I can find a fix. No longer throws an error. ***hyd-n-plyn-syt***
