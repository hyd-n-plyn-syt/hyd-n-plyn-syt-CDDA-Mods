# Changes

- Added waterproof e-ink tablet PC case. Compared it to camera and phone case weights versus device weights and made some judgements. Despite the container being of correct proportions, kept throwing an error saying the inside was larger than the outside. Marked it as TARDIS as suggested until I can find a fix. No longer throws an error. 
- Added cases for both versions of the AR glasses, wearable over the eyes like any other eyewear. Do not seem to effect perception. Devices are fully functional I had to make one for each device, as they have wildly different weights and volumes, which is I suppose to be expected. Look at the Quest over the Quest 3.
- Added in a case for the mp3 player. Still hear that glorious music too. Yus.
- Fixed the larger on the inside than outside issue by adjusting the volume of the cases to be 5ml larger than the object the hold, across the board. And so, removed the TARDIS flag with no errors after. Went back and figured out how to make changes to pre-existing items and changed the smart phone case to that same logic, reducing it's size by 45ml. That's a lot of extra plastic that was taking up room with something that hugs the device directly.
